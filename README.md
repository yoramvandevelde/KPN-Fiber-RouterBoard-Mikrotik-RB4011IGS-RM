# KPN Fiber configuration for RouterOS

This is my basic configuration for my RouterBoard Mikrotik RB4011IGS+RM router for use with a gigabit fiber connection from the Dutch ISP KPN. This might help someone get their own setup to work. 

The file is heavely commented but still can be entered using copy/pasta (after you change the stuff enclosed in brackets).
